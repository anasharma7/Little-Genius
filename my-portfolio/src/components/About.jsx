              I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong interest in creating
              beautiful, functional web applications. I love learning new technologies
              and building things that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in development has taught me to value clean code, user
              experience, and continuous improvement. I'm always looking for new
              challenges and opportunities to grow.
